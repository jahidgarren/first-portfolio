        <h1><span class="head-name"> Jahid Abir</span> Portfolio</h1>
        <h3> Professional web designer and developer</h3>
        <P> I have been designing and developing websites for over 1 years, and have enjoyed being a WordPress specialist for the last 12. The sites I build are mobile friendly, fast loading, SEO optimised, beautiful in design with an intuitive interface to enable visitor’s to quickly access content. WordPress is my preferred choice for web development and my clients love it’s ease of use too.With a client base coming from a variety of businesses I’ve successfully completed website projects for such companies as PharSafer®, a global leader in Pharmacovigilance and for the Rochester Bridge Trust who maintain this famous historic bridge across the River Medway.My interest in web design started out by learning the basics of HTML through manuals and magazines, then using software packages such as Dreamweaver, Fireworks and Photoshop. These days I’m mostly hand coding in a text editor using the technologies of HTML5, PHP, MySql and jQuery.</P>
